# Conga
Basic HTTP queue that stores JSON objects in memory. 

Allows users to POST JSON objects that are then stored in a queue. JSON Objects can then be previewed and fetched (Ingested and Removed) from the queue.

API keys can be configured by supplying the `api_keys` string array in the config (see sample provided in config/conga.toml). If no keys are supplied, auth is disabled.

OpenAPI docs can be found [here](openapi.json), These are generated by the service at `/api-doc/openapi.json`
